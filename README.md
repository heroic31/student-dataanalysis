Student Performance Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student performance data to understand the factors influencing GPA and make predictions using Apache Spark. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a regression model to predict student performance.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset (student_performance_data.csv).
notebooks/: Includes Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts used for analysis and visualization.
src/: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction tasks.
Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Apache Spark: Ensure Spark is properly installed and configured.
Python 3.x: Along with the following packages:
pyspark
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyspark matplotlib seaborn
Getting Started
Initialize Spark Session: Start a Spark session to work with the data.

Load Data: Import the dataset from the CSV file.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and prepare the data by encoding categorical variables and assembling features.

Feature Engineering and Modeling:

Create a pipeline to process the data and scale features.
Train a Linear Regression model to predict GPA based on various student features.
Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new student data.

Visualizations
The project includes visualizations to explore data distribution and correlations, utilizing Matplotlib and Seaborn.
